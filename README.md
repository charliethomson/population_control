# population control
An application to emulate a naive house of representatives apportionment algorithm, 
inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JN4RI7nkes) by 
[CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) talking about 
apporitonment, [where he says](https://youtu.be/6JN4RI7nkes?t=438) how he thought 
the US doled out the House seats (which is not how they do it [see "naive implementation"])

I wanted to do it so here it is.
I was tired, the code is bad, not worth refactoring, so here it will stay forever -- ugly
